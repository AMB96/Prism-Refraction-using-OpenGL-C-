# Slope Field using OpenGL

Takes input of a first-order differential equation in the form of ' f(x)dx = g(y)dy ' and its coefficient values to calculate the tangents of the slope field at various point.
On left-mouse click, it displays the tangent at that specific point and on pressing spacebar, it displays the whole slope field for the given equation.
